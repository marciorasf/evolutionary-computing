function [f]=fitness_nq(solution)
% returns the amount of collisions for a given solution (permutation).
% the maximum amount of collisions that can occur is n(n-1)/2.
% for a 4x4 chessboard, the maximum amount of collisions is 6, corresponding 
% to the situation in which all queens are in the same diagonal.
